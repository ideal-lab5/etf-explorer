# Ideal Labs Explorer

To run the explorer, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, configure your Ideal Labs Node URI in your .env path

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_WS="ws://127.0.0.1:9944"
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website. 3000 is nextjs default port but it could be different in your environment.
